# fancontrol
Enabling CLI-control of pwm enabled system fans in linux

## Why this program?
As a linux user with an AMD GPU running with amdgpu drivers I miss the possibility of changing the fanspeeds of my GPU.
This tool is intended to be used in CLI for now but I'm planning a pretty UI-project which will be using this tool.

## What is working?
- Showing name, temperature and fanspeed in percent.

## What is being currently worked on?
- Changing fan speed
- (Interactive(?)) Interface for usage by other programs (e.g. GUIs)

## What may come?
- Makefile
- AUR Repo
